## 2025-02-09 - Path Traversal in BatchOutputPort
**Vulnerability:** `BatchOutputPort` allowed arbitrary file writes via path traversal because it did not validate the `output_path` parameter, passing user-controlled paths directly to `open()`.
**Learning:** File storage ports (e.g. `BatchOutputPort`, `LocalFileStorage`) must actively validate that the resolved path is confined within a safe `base_path`. A default behavior of lacking a `base_path` fails open, creating critical risks.
**Prevention:** Require a `base_path` parameter with a safe default (or explicitly pass it from callers), resolve all paths with `os.path.realpath`, and use `os.path.commonpath` to ensure the final path resides within the base directory. If an attempt to escape is detected, raise `PathTraversalError`.

## 2025-02-09 - Path Traversal in BatchInputPort
**Vulnerability:** `BatchInputPort` allowed arbitrary file reads via path traversal because it did not validate the `file_path` parameter, passing user-controlled paths directly to `open()`.
**Learning:** Similarly to output ports, file storage input ports (e.g. `BatchInputPort`) must actively validate that the resolved path is confined within a safe `base_path`. A default behavior of lacking a `base_path` fails open, creating critical risks.
**Prevention:** Require a `base_path` parameter with a safe default (or explicitly pass it from callers), resolve all paths with `os.path.realpath`, and use `os.path.commonpath` to ensure the final path resides within the base directory. If an attempt to escape is detected, raise `PathTraversalError`.

## 2025-02-27 - Fail-Open Path Traversal Default Argument
**Vulnerability:** BatchInputPort's `base_path` argument defaulted to `None`, which triggered a complete bypass of path traversal confinement logic (`if base_path is not None:`).
**Learning:** Defaulting optional security parameters to `None` and treating `None` as a signal to skip security checks creates a fail-open design pattern, allowing unrestricted access.
**Prevention:** Default base paths for file operations should be `""` (empty string) to represent the current working directory, enabling a fail-closed model where confinement checks are always enforced.
